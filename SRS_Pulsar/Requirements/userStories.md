# User stories
## Users:
1. As user I want to read filterbank files in my program, so we can use the astronomical data in scientific programs.
2. As user I want to write filterbank files in my program, so we can write astronomical data in scientific program
3. As user, I want to downsample given input, so it can be used in a later stage.
4. As user, I want clear exceptions when something is not set right, so I can more easily debug my program.

## Students:
1. As student I don’t want to worry about thread safety, so it’s usable in highly threaded applications.
2. As student I want that LibrePulsar is easily imported, so I can import it easily in other projects.
3. As a student, I want that  LibrePulsar runs on limited PC hardware, so I can test my projects on my personal computer.

## Scientific programmer:
1. As scientific programmer I want  that my filterbank reader performs with very large datasets (+1TB of data), which is often the case in software
2. As scientific programmer I want that my filterbank writer performs with very large datasets(+1TB of data), which is often the case in software
3. As scientific programmer, I want to downsample large sizes the input time series(+1TB) so it can be used in astronomical projects
